    "react": "^16.10.2",

I used react-bootstrap for the accordion component and the tab component for exercise 2

I used bootstrap in my html markup to use flex box and some simple styling

To make things easier I combined 1 and 2 into the same code base.
There is a nav bar at the top of the page to navigate between the two examples

I used some sass to utilise breakpoints exercise 1
